        "description": "A tool for reading files (e.g. `cat -n`), or listing files/directories (e.g. `ls -la` or `find . -maxdepth 2). The behavior of this tool is determined by the `path` parameter pointing to a file or directory.\n* If `path` is a file, this tool returns the result of running `cat -n`, and the optional `readRange` determines what range of lines will be read from the specified file.\n* If `path` is a directory, this tool returns the listed files and directories of the specified path, as if running `ls -la`. If the `readRange` parameter is provided, the tool acts like the `find . -maxdepth <readRange>`, where `readRange` is the number of subdirectories deep to search, e.g. [2] will run `find . -maxdepth 2`.",
