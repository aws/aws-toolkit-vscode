This is the core of the telemetry service client for the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

service-2.json is generated internally.

clienttelemetry.d.ts is autogenerated from service-2.json using the AWS JS SDK. This is incorporated into the
`postinstall` npm step.

build/generateServiceClient.ts generates clienttelemetry.d.ts

Client ID is generated and stored/retrieved in `createDefaultPublisher()`:
