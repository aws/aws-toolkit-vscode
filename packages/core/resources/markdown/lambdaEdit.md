# Welcome to Lambda local development

Learn how to view your Lambda function locally, iterate, and deploy changes to the AWS Cloud.

## Edit your Lambda function

-   Make changes to your function code and save it. You will be prompted to deploy if you're done editing. You can come back later if you have more changes to make.
-   Using the terminal and your favorite package manager, add dependencies for your project.

## Manage your Lambda functions

-   Select the AWS Toolkit icon in the left sidebar and select **EXPLORER**
-   In your desired region, select the Lambda dropdown menu:
    -   To save and deploy a previously edited Lambda function, select the ![deploy](./deploy.svg) icon next to your Lambda function.
    -   To remotely invoke a function, select the ![invoke](./invoke.svg) icon next to your Lambda function.

## Advanced features

-   To convert to a Lambda function to an AWS SAM application, select the ![createStack](./create-stack.svg) icon next to your Lambda function. For details on what AWS SAM is and how it can help you, see the [AWS Serverless Application Model Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html).
