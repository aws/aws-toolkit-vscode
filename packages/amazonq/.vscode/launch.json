            To get an understanding why we need the following:
              - comment out the following
              - set a breakpoint in VS Code that gets triggerd on extension startup
            Now in the Chrome Developer Tools menu, the extension will load slower and open up random files.
            I think this is due to source maps for irrelevant code being attempted to be resolved and slowing execution.

            What this is doing is ignoring certain modules that match the following paths, it matches the path of
            a file in `Developer Tools` > `Sources`.
            I was inspired by this: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-test-web/blob/897bca4907a87a6bc564efc242ce6794e5da3232/.vscode/launch.json#L28
