# <a id="top"></a>AWS Toolkit

The AWS Toolkit extension for AWS Cloud9 that enables you to interact with [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/).
See the [user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/toolkit-welcome.html) for complete documentation.

Try the [AWS Code Sample Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/code-samples/latest/catalog/welcome.html) to start coding with the AWS SDK.

## <a id="ui-components-aws-expl"></a>AWS Explorer

The **AWS Explorer** provides access to the AWS services that you can work with when using the Toolkit. To see the **AWS Explorer**, choose the **AWS** icon in the **Activity bar**.

## ![Overview, AWS Explorer](./resources/marketplace/cloud9/overview-aws-explorer-en.png)

## <a id="ui-components-dev-tools"></a>Developer Tools

The **Developer Tools** panel is a section for developer-focused tooling curated for working in an IDE. The **Developer Tools** panel can be found underneath the **AWS Explorer** when the **AWS icon** is selected in the **Activity bar**.

## <a id="ui-components-cdk-expl"></a>CDK Explorer

The **AWS CDK Explorer** enables you to work with [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) applications. It shows a top-level view of your CDK applications that have been sythesized in your workspace.

With the CDK explorer, you can navigate the CDK application's infrastructure stacks, resources, and policies.

For full details see the [AWS CDK Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/cdk-explorer.html) in the user guide.

## <a id="codewhisperer"></a>Amazon CodeWhisperer

**Amazon CodeWhisperer** provides inline code suggestions using machine learning and natural language processing on the contents of your current file. Supported languages include: Java, Python and Javascript.

Once enabled, CodeWhisperer will provide code suggestions automatically and can also be requested manually using option+c (mac) / alt+c (PC). To accept a suggestion and add it to your file, press Tab, Enter or click on it. To dismiss a suggestion, press escape or keep typing.

For more information, see [Amazon CodeWhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer) in our user guide.

## <a id="sam-and-lambda"></a> AWS Serverless Applications

The AWS Toolkit enables you to develop [AWS serverless applications](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) locally. It also provides _Inline Actions_ in Cloud9 to do the following:

-   Use SAM (serverless application model) templates to build and debug your locally developed AWS serverless applications.
-   Run selected [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions.

To start debugging with a SAM template, click the `Add Debug Configuration` _Inline Action_ in the template file.

![Add Debug Configuration Template](./resources/marketplace/cloud9/Codelens-YAML-template.png)

###### The _Inline Action_ indicator in the SAM template allows you to add a debug configuration for the serverless application.</h6>

Alternatively, you can run and debug just the AWS Lambda function and exclude other resources defined by the SAM template. Again, use an _Inline Action_ indicator for an AWS Lambda-function handler. (A _handler_ is a function that Lambda calls to start execution of a Lambda function.)

![Add Debug Configuration Direct](./resources/marketplace/cloud9/Codelens-direct-function.png)

###### The _Inline Action_ indicator in the application file lets you add a debug configuration for a selected AWS Lambda function.

When you run a debug session, the status and results are shown in the **AWS Toolkit** output channel. If the toolkit does not have an open **AWS Toolkit** output channel, one can be created with the New Tab button.

![Configure and Run](./resources/marketplace/cloud9/sam-configure-and-run-still-en.png)

###### After a local run is complete, the output appears in the **OUTPUT** tab.

When you're satisfied with performance, you can [deploy your serverless application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/deploy-serverless-app.html). The SAM template is converted to a CloudFormation template, which is then used to deploy all the application's assets to the AWS Cloud.

### Supported runtimes

The Toolkit _local SAM debugging_ feature supports these runtimes:

-   JavaScript (Node.js 14.x, 16.x)
-   Python (3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)

For more information see [Working with AWS Serverless Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/serverless-apps-toolkit.html) in the user guide.
