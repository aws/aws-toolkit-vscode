# <a id="top"></a>AWS Toolkit

AWS Toolkit is an extension for AWS Cloud9 that enables you to interact with [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/).
See the [AWS Toolkit user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/toolkit-welcome.html) for complete documentation.

See [Get help](#get-help) for support.

## <a id="ui-components-aws-expl"></a>AWS Explorer

The **AWS Explorer** provides access to the AWS services that you can work with when using the Toolkit. To see the **AWS Explorer**, choose the **AWS** icon in the **Activity bar**.

## <a id="sam-and-lambda"></a> AWS Serverless Applications

The AWS Toolkit enables you to develop [AWS serverless applications](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) locally. It also provides _Inline Actions_ in Cloud9 to do the following:

-   Use SAM (serverless application model) templates to build and debug your locally developed AWS serverless applications.
-   Run selected [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions.

To start debugging with a SAM template, click the `Add Debug Configuration` _Inline Action_ in the template file.

![Add Debug Configuration Template](./resources/marketplace/cloud9/Codelens-YAML-template.png)

###### The _Inline Action_ indicator in the SAM template allows you to add a debug configuration for the serverless application.</h6>

Alternatively, you can run and debug just the AWS Lambda function and exclude other resources defined by the SAM template. Again, use an _Inline Action_ indicator for an AWS Lambda-function handler. (A _handler_ is a function that Lambda calls to start execution of a Lambda function.)

![Add Debug Configuration Direct](./resources/marketplace/cloud9/Codelens-direct-function.png)

###### The _Inline Action_ indicator in the application file lets you add a debug configuration for a selected AWS Lambda function.

When you run a debug session, the status and results are shown in the **AWS Toolkit** output channel. If the toolkit does not have an open **AWS Toolkit** output channel, one can be created with the New Tab button.

![Configure and Run 2](./resources/marketplace/cloud9/sam-configure-and-run-still-2.png)

###### After a local run is complete, the output appears in the **OUTPUT** tab.

When you're satisfied with performance, you can [deploy your serverless application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/deploy-serverless-app.html). The SAM template is converted to a CloudFormation template, which is then used to deploy all the application's assets to the AWS Cloud.

### Supported runtimes

The Toolkit _local SAM debugging_ feature supports these runtimes:

-   JavaScript (Node.js 10.x, 12.x, 14.x)
-   Python (3.7, 3.8)

For more information see [Working with AWS Serverless Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/serverless-apps-toolkit.html) in the user guide.
