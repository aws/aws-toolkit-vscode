 * This class handles feature access for unreleased or gated features.
 * Example: adding a feature called `NewFeature1`:
 *
 * Add the following to the `featureToggle.ActiveFeatureKeys` enum:
 *
 * ```
 * export enum ActiveFeatureKeys {
 *     NewFeature1 = 'NewFeature1'
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You can then gate your feature with the following code (returning a boolean):
 *
 * ```
 * FeatureToggle.isFeatureActive(featureToggle.ActiveFeatureKeys.NewFeature1)
 * ```
 *
 * Finally, you can access the gated feature by adding the following snippet to the VS Code `settings.json` file:
 *
 * ```
 *     "aws.experimentalFeatureFlags": [
 *         "NewFeature1",
 *     ],
 * ```
