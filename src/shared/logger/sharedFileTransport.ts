/**
 * TODO: Figure out why the log file is not being properly appended to
 *
 * Problem:
 * - Doing multiple log calls will not properly append to the log file
 * - Only the last log call is written to the log file
 * - Looking in to the append() call, when it first reads the current content
 *   it would not have any of the previous logs in it.
 * - The `next()` method is intended to signal that the current log is done being
 *   written to the file but that is not working by the looks of it.
 * Temporary Solution:
 * - I created a buffer that buffers incoming logs and batch writes them after
 *   a certain timeout. This seems to improve things
 * - Also the current append implementation is inefficient due to the underlying api
 *   (reads whole file, concatenates, then writes) so buffering is beneficial here.
