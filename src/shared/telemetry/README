This is the core of the telemetry service client for the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

service-2.json is generated internally.

clienttelemetry.d.ts is autogenerated from service-2.json using the AWS JS SDK

generate_types.sh automates the process of generating clienttelemetry.d.ts



Manual steps to generate a new type file:

* Get a fresh copy of the AWS JS SDK from https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js.git to $AWS_SDK_DIR
* Change your working directory to $AWS_SDK_DIR
* Copy the 'service-2.json' to '$AWS_SDK_DIR/apis/clienttelemetry-<date>.normal.json'
* Add an entry similar to the blob below to '$AWS_SDK_DIR/apis/metadata.json'

    clienttelemetry : {
        "name": "ClientTelemetry'
    }

* run 'node scripts/typings-generator.js'
* copy the generated type file from '$AWS_SDK_DIR/clients/clienttelemetry.d.ts' to this directory
* replace the imports in 'clienttelemetry.d.ts' to be relative to sdk module instead of the parent directory
   * i.e. import from 'aws-sdk/lib/request' instead of '../lib/request'
* add a header to clienttelemetry.d.ts stating that it is autogenerated
* cleanup by deleting $AWS_SDK_DIR
