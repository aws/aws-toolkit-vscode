 * Empties and deletes the bucket, showing a progress bar.
 * Refreshes the parent node.

 * Note that this just repeatedly calls list and delete to empty the bucket before deletion.
 * Failures during the emptying or deleting step can leave the bucket in a state where
 * some (or all) objects are deleted, but the bucket remains.

 * This is unfortunate, but it's still a valuable feature and partial failures
