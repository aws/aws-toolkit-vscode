# Third Party components

## VS Code Icons

Some UI icons are sourced from [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) to provide a consistent look and feel. These files are located within [third-party/resources/from-vscode](resources/from-vscode).

[Visual Studio Code Icons](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-icons) were moved to their own repository in August 2019. These files are located within [third-party/resources/from-vscode-icons](resources/from-vscode-icons).

## Google Fonts

Sourced from [Google Fonts](https://github.com/google/fonts), an open source library of font files and icons. These files are used to fill the gaps of VS Code's icon and/or font selection. The icons are licensed under [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/LICENSE).
