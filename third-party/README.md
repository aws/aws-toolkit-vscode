## Code coverage test harness

WARNING: This package has been modified from the original Open Source MIT licensed [project](https://github.com/codecov/example-typescript-vscode-extension).

The test runner is sourced from [Codecov VSCode Extension Example](https://github.com/codecov/example-typescript-vscode-extension). This test runner is invoked by the VS Code extension, and orchestrates the [istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) coverage package.

The file is located in [third-party/test/index.ts](test/index.ts). Its original source is located at https://github.com/codecov/example-typescript-vscode-extension/blob/master/test/index.ts

## VS Code Icons

Some UI icons are sourced from [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) to provide a consistent look and feel. These files are located within [third-party/resources/from-vscode](resources/from-vscode).

[Visual Studio Code Icons](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-icons) were moved to their own repository in August 2019. These files are located within [third-party/resources/from-vscode-icons](resources/from-vscode-icons).
