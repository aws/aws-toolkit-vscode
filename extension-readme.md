## <a id="additional-setup-steps"></a>Additional Setup Steps

After you install the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, you must complete these additional steps to access most of its features:

1. [Create an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) and an [access key](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/).
1. Connect the Toolkit to AWS by using [AWS credentials](#managing-aws-resources).

To use this Toolkit to develop [serverless applications with AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/), you must also do the following on the local machine where the Toolkit is installed:

1. Install the [AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).
1. Install and then run [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
1. Install the [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html).

For complete setup instructions, see [Setting Up the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) in the _AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code User Guide_.

#### Step 1: Set Up a Credentials Profile

1. If you already have an AWS credentials profile, skip ahead to "Step 2: Connect to an AWS Account." (For additional information, see [Setting Up Your AWS Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/setup-credentials.html) in the _AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code User Guide_.)
1. On the menu bar, choose **View, Command Palette**.
1. Begin typing: `AWS: Create Credentials Profile`. When you see the **AWS: Create Credentials Profile** command, choose it.
1. Follow the on-screen instructions to add AWS credentials profile information. (For additional information, see [Setting Up Your AWS Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/setup-credentials.html) in the _AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code User Guide_.) 

#### Step 2: Connect to an AWS Account

1. On the menu bar, choose **View, Command Palette**.
1. Begin typing `AWS: Connect to AWS`. When you see the **AWS: Connect to AWS** command, choose it.
1. In the list of AWS credentials profiles that is displayed, choose the AWS credentials profile that you want to use. (For additional information, see [Setting Up Your AWS Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/setup-credentials.html) in the _AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code User Guide_.)

#### Step 3: Work with Available AWS Resources

1. If the **AWS: Explorer** Side Bar isn't displayed, display it by choosing the **AWS** icon in the Activity Bar. (To hide the **AWS: Explorer**, choose the **AWS** icon again.)
1. If you have existing resources in your AWS account but they aren't displayed in the **AWS: Explorer**, choose the **Refresh** icon in the **AWS: Explorer** to display them. 
1. Expand the AWS Region that contains the resource that you want to manage. (To hide or show AWS Region information, choose **View, Command Palette** on the menu bar, and then choose **AWS: Hide region from the Explorer** or **AWS: Show region in the Explorer**.)
1. Expand the AWS service that contains the resource that you want to manage. (Currently, the Toolkit doesn't support all available AWS services and resource types.)
1. If applicable, expand the parent resource that contains the child resource that you want to manage.
1. Right-click the resource to manage, and then choose one of the available actions in the context menu. (Currently, the Toolkit doesn't support all available resource actions.)

For more information, see the following in the _AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code User Guide_:

![Configure and Run](./resources/marketplace/sam-configure-and-run.gif)

(_Clip is time lapsed_)

After you choose the **AWS** icon in the Activity Bar, CodeLenses display within open serverless application code files above functions that use AWS Lambda function handler syntax. (A _handler_ is a function that Lambda calls to start execution of a Lambda function.) These CodeLenses enable you to run or debug the corresponding serverless application locally. CodeLens actions here include:

* **Configure**, for specifying function configurations such as an event payload and environment variables.
* **Run Locally**, for running the function without debugging.
* **Debug Locally**, for running the function with debugging.

Before CodeLenses appear in Python code, you must install a Visual Studio Code extension that provides both language and debugger support for Python. We have tested this with the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension.

(For general information about running and debugging in VS Code, see [Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) on the VS Code website.)

For information about how to work with remote versions of Lambda functions, see [Interacting with Remote Lambda Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/remote-lambda.html) in the _AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code User Guide_.

#### <a id="deploy-serverless-application"></a>Deploy a Serverless Application

![Deploy SAM Application](./resources/marketplace/sam-deploy.gif)

(_Clip is time lapsed_)

Before you start this procedure, you must have an Amazon S3 bucket in the AWS account. The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code will use this bucket when packaging and deploying the application. (To create a bucket, see [How Do I Create an S3 Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-bucket.html) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide_.)  

1. On the menu bar, choose **View, Command Palette**.
1. Begin typing: `AWS: Deploy SAM Application`. When you see the **AWS: Deploy SAM Application** command, choose it.
1. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish deploying the serverless application, including:
    
   1. Choosing the SAM template file that corresponds with the serverless application you want to deploy.
   1. Choosing the AWS Region you want to deploy to.
   1. Specifying the name of an existing Amazon S3 bucket in the AWS account that the Toolkit will use for packaging and deploying the serverless application. (The Toolkit uses Amazon S3 as part of its process to deploy serverless applications.) The bucket must exist within the AWS Region that you chose earlier.

1. The serverless application is deployed to an AWS CloudFormation stack. (The Toolkit uses AWS CloudFormation as part of its process to deploy serverless applications.) If the stack already exists, it is updated; otherwise, a new stack is created. Within a few minutes, the Toolkit displays a deployment success or failure message.
1. To work with the corresponding stack that the Toolkit creates in AWS CloudFormation, in the **AWS: Explorer**, expand the AWS Region that contains the stack. Then expand **AWS CloudFormation**. Lastly, expand or right-click on the stack that you want to manage.

For more information, see [Deploying a Serverless Application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/deploy-serverless-app.html) in the _AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code User Guide_.
