# <a id="top"></a>AWS Toolkit

The _AWS Toolkit_, or simply the _Toolkit_, is an extension that enables you to interact with certain services of [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/) from within the VS Code editor.

The following screenshots show important parts of the Toolkit.

### <a id="open-command-palette"></a>AWS commands in the Command Palette

The Toolkit leverages Visual Studio Code's **Command Palette** to provide rapid access to [AWS-specific commands](#aws-commands).

# <a id="feature-overview"></a>Feature overview

You can use the AWS Toolkit to interact with several AWS resources in various ways.

These include the following:

-   AWS Serverless Applications

-   AWS Lambda functions

-   AWS CloudFormation stacks

-   AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) applications

-   Amazon EventBridge schemas

-   Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task definition files

-   AWS Step Functions state machines

See [Features](#features) below for high-level details, or jump right into the [_AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code User Guide_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/toolkit-for-vscode/welcome).

# <a id="additional-setup-steps"></a>Setup

To access most features of the AWS Toolkit, you must complete the steps defined in the [Setting Up](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/toolkit-for-vscode/getting-started) topic of the user guide.

These steps include the following:

1. Create an AWS account (see the [Prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/toolkit-for-vscode/setup-toolkit#setup-prereq) in the user guide and also these [additional details](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/))
1. Create and configure a set of AWS credentials (see [Establishing Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/establish-credentials.html) in the user guide)
1. Connect the Toolkit to AWS using those credentials (see [Connecting to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/toolkit-for-vscode/connect) in the user guide)

To use the Toolkit to develop [serverless applications with AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/), you must also [set up your toolchain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/toolkit-for-vscode/setup-toolchain) and do the following on the local machine where the Toolkit is installed:

1. Install the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
1. Install and start Docker (also see this general information about [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/))
1. Install the AWS SAM CLI

For complete setup instructions for these three components, see [Installing the AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) in the _AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) Developer Guide_.

## <a id="sam-and-lambda"></a> AWS Serverless Applications 

The AWS Toolkit enables you to develop [AWS serverless applications](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) locally. It also allows you to use _CodeLens_&mdash;a Visual Studio Code feature&mdash;to do the following:
-   Use SAM (serverless application model) templates to build and debug your locally developed AWS serverless applications.
-   Run and debug specific [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions. 


After you've [created a serverless application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/toolkit-for-vscode/create-sam), you can locally run and debug it using a SAM template. This YAML-formatted file describes resources such as functions, APIs, databases, and event-source mappings that make up a serverless application. 

To start debugging with a SAM template, choose `Add Debug Configuration` from the _CodeLens_ indicator in the template file.    

![Add Debug Configuration Template](./resources/marketplace/Codelens-YAML-template.png)
###### The _CodeLens_ indicator in the SAM template allows you to add a debug configuration for the serverless application.</h6>

Alternatively, you can run and debug just the AWS Lambda function and exclude other resources defined by the SAM template. Again, use a _CodeLens_ indicator for an AWS Lambda-function handler. (A _handler_ is a function that Lambda calls to start execution of a Lambda function.) 

![Add Debug Configuration Direct](./resources/marketplace/Codelens-direct-function.png)

###### The _CodeLens_ indicator in the application file lets you add a debug configuration for a selected AWS Lambda function.


When you run a debug session, the status and results are displayed in the **OUTPUT** panel when the **AWS Toolkit** output channel is selected.

![Configure and Run 1](./resources/marketplace/sam-configure-and-run-still-2.png)

###### After a local run is complete, the output appears in the **OUTPUT** tab.


When you're satisfied with performance, you can [deploy your serverless application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/toolkit-for-vscode/deploy-serverless-app). During deployment, the SAM template is converted to a CloudFormation template, which is then used to configure all your application's resources in the AWS Cloud. 

### Additional information about CodeLenses 

The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code supports _CodeLens_-enabled debugging for the following languages and runtimes: 

* C# (.NET Core 2.1)
* JavaScript (Node.js 10.x, 12.x)
* Python (2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8)

For more information, see the [AWS Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/aws-explorer.html) in the Toolkit's user guide.

## <a id="cdk-apps"></a>AWS CDK applications

The AWS Toolkit enables you to work with [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) applications. Using the [AWS CDK Explorer](#ui-components-cdk-expl) on the Toolkit, you can view CDK applications within your Workspace that have been synthesized.

Example:

![AWS CDK Tree View](./resources/marketplace/cdk-tree-view.png)

For full details, see the [AWS CDK Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/cdk-explorer.html) in the Toolkit's user guide.

## <a id="eventbridge"></a>Amazon EventBridge schemas

The AWS Toolkit provides support for [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge) schemas. Using the [AWS Explorer](#ui-components-aws-expl) of the Toolkit, you can perform the following operations on these schemas:

-   View an available schema
-   Search for an available schema
-   Generate code for an available schema

Example:

![View Amazon EventBridge Schemas](./resources/marketplace/eventbridge-search.png)

For full details, see [Working with Amazon EventBridge Schemas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/toolkit-for-vscode/eventbridge-schemas) in the Toolkit's user guide.

## <a id="ecs-files"></a>Amazon ECS task definition files

The AWS Toolkit provides support for [Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs). With the Toolkit installed in VS Code, IntelliSense functionality is provided for Amazon ECS task-definition files that you are updating in the editor.

Example:

![Amazon ECS IntelliSense for Task Definition Files](./resources/marketplace/ecs-task-def-intellisense.png)

For full details, see [Working with Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/ecs.html) in the Toolkit's user guide.

## <a id="sfn-files"></a>AWS Step Functions

The AWS Toolkit provides support for [AWS Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions). With the Toolkit installed in VS Code, working with state machines is a more streamlined process.

-   Create, update, execute, and download state machines.
-   See live graph visualizations of your state machine.
-   Take advantage of features such as code completion and validation, and code snippets.

Example:

![AWS Step Functions](./resources/marketplace/sfn-state-machine.png)

For full details, see [Working with AWS Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/stepfunctions.html) in the Toolkit's user guide.
