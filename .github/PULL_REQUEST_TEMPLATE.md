- Treat all work as PUBLIC. Private `feature/x` branches will not be squash-merged at release time.
- Your code changes must meet the guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#guidelines).
- License: I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.
