The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code is an extension for working with AWS services such as AWS Lambda.

The toolkit is in preview and only available if built from source. This is pre-release software and we recommend against using it in a production environment.

This is an open source project because we want you to be involved. We love issues, feature requests, code reviews, pull requests or any positive contribution.

## Getting Started
