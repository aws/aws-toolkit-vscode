# Code guidelines

This document describes code guidelines and technical considerations for AWS
Toolkit for VSCode. It provides answers to common questions, decisions, UX and
project consistency, questions of style and code structure, and anything else
that cannot be enforced by a `lint` build-task.


## Naming

Naming is one of the central opportunities for you as a human to add value to
a project.  Over-specifying names ("premature explanation") is a common habit
that is a net cost.

> The precision of naming takes away from the uniqueness of seeing.
â€• Pierre Bonnard

- Do not use "AWS" in command names. The "AWS" brand is [not used China](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode/pull/1786).
  It's very confusing (for documentation, community guidance, etc.) to have
  different command names (in the _same_ language) for different regions.
- Use consistent patterns for similar concepts.
    - Example: `getLambdaFileName` vs `parseLambdaDetailsFromConfiguration`
        - Using "get" as a verb is useful because it has parallel form with other
          similar "get" functions in this family: `getResourceFromTemplate`,
          `getRuntime`, etc.
        - They aren't in the same modules. But they are similar concepts. This
          helps discoverability and signals to other humans the behavior of the
          symbols without having to consume the implementation.
- Use common names unless there is a strong, conscious reason to use
  a variant/uncommon name.
    - "Info" is more common that "Details".
    - "Get" is more common than "Retrieve"
        - "Fetch" might be used to indicate that special work is being done vs
          some other existing (or potential) "Get" counterpart in the same
          module. Ask: If the function is _not_ doing special work then why is
          it named "Fetch" instead of "Get"?
- Over-specifying names:
    - Counteracts re-use and discoverability
    - Creates churn when the implementation changes, because then the name
      needs to change (it doesn't matter that `getLambdaFileName` is "parsing"
      its input--unless parsing is a central requirement of the function, and
      differentiates it from other similar functions).
- _Most_ code related to topic "Foo" should live in `foo.ts`.
    - "Utility" functions:
        - Code related to "Foo" but (1) not strongly dependent on its types,
          and (2) broadly usable by other modules, may live in
          `src/utilities/foo.ts`.
        - Code related to "Foo" that _is strongly dependent_ on its types, may
          live in `src/foo/util.ts`.
        - `src/foo/utilities/` is never (in a project <1M LoC) needed.

## Project guidelines

- Telemetry: "active" vs "passive"
  - Active (`passive:false`) metrics are those intended to appear in DAU count.
- Icons:
  - Where possible, use IDE-specific standard icons (e.g. standard VSCode
    standard icons in VSCode, and Cloud9 standard icons in Cloud9). The typical
    (maintainable) way to do this is to use _named_ icons (what VSCode calls
    [codicons](https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-codicons/)) as opposed to
    icons shipped with the Toolkit build and referenced by _path_.
  - For cases where icons must be statically defined (package.json), if Cloud9
    does not support the VSCode standard icon, use the Cloud9 icon.
- Changelog guidelines
  - Prefer active voice: "You can do X" instead of "X can be done"
- Avoid unnecessary use of `lodash` (which we may remove in the future).
  Functions such as `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`, and many others are
  already available from ES6/typescript.
- Do not habitually define concepts one-per-file. Related classes, interfaces,
  and symbols should live in the same module unless there is an explicit,
  conscious motivation for separating them.
- What is a "unit test"? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM
  - Unit is not "a single class", it's a piece of the software with a clear
    boundary. It might be a whole microservice, or a chunk of a monolith that
    is internally consistent.
- User-facing messages (and log messages):
  - Put the variable part of a message at the end, preceded by a colon.
    - `'foo failed: {0}'`
  - If a message has many variable parts, mention them in the message in
    a natural way, but surround them with quotes:
    - `'creating "{0}" in directory: {1}'`
  - Localize UI messages. Do _not_ localize log and exception messages.
  - Use `extensionUtilities.getIdeProperties()` to automatically match IDE
    terminology (e.g. VS Code : CodeLens :: AWS Cloud9 : Inline Action)
- Bubble-up error conditions, do not sink them to random hidden places (such as
  logs only), expecting callers to figure out the failure mode. If a caller
  spawns a process that fails, the caller should get an exception, callback, or
  return value indicating that some descendant in the call-chain failed, with
  the failure reason.
- Refactoring tools allow us to avoid "premature abstraction". Avoid wrappers
  until the need is clear and obvious.

## Test guidelines

- Test real codepaths, avoid mocks.
  - Example 1: instead of mocking various aspects of the `sam local invoke`
    codepath, assert the string representation of the CLI command generated by
    `samCliBuild.ts`
  - Example 2: instead of mocking various aspects of `sam local invoke`
    codepath, shift all CONFIG decisions earlier in the codepath and test the
    real values.
  - Both examples result in faster, more-readable, more-useful tests, and more
    test-coverage of real codepaths.

## Code guidelines

- Use maps to group variables, rather than ad-hoc/informal grouping.
  [Example](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode/blob/abed2c4c7e1329da785190e286e567525afa9da5/src/test/shared/utilities/timeoutUtils.test.ts#L107-L113)
  - PREFER:
    ```
    let topic = {
      var1 = 'foo',
      var2 = 'bar',
    }
    ```
  - INSTEAD OF:
    ```
    let topicVar1 = 'foo'
    let topicVar2 = 'bar'
    ```
- Where formal grouping is not possible, use a common prefix in names to help
  discoverability and help other developers understand "these symbols are
  related".
  - PREFER:
    ```
    export interface AwsSamDebuggerConfigLoose extends AwsSamDebuggerConfig {
      ...
    }
    ```
  - INSTEAD OF:
    ```
    export interface MorePermissiveAwsSamDebuggerConfig extends AwsSamDebuggerConfig {
      ...
    }
    ```
- Use module-qualified names, to avoid aliasing members.
  - PREFER:
    ```
    import * as foo from '../foo'
    const result = foo.Result
    ```
  - INSTEAD OF:
    ```
    import { Result as FooResult } from '../foo'
    const result = FooResult
    ```
- Use small names for small scopes.
  - PREFER:
    ```
    things.filter(o => o.isFoo)
    ```
  - INSTEAD OF:
    ```
    things.filter(thing => thing.isFoo)
    ```

## User settings

- Global scope is shared across all vscode instances *including* remote/SSH
  instances. Programmatically setting a Global scope config value will raise
  the onDidChangeConfiguration event for all (local and remote) vscode
  instances.
- https://github.com/clangd/vscode-clangd/issues/25#issuecomment-627505249
  >  We write clangd.path to the user config (local ~/.config/Code/settings.json)
  >  rather than the machine config (remote ~/.vscode-server/data/Machine/settings.json).
  > This has two problems:
  > 1. if you already have a clangd.path in your remote workspace config, then it
  >    will take precedence over the local user one.
  > 2. setting clangd.path in your local config, to a path that isn't present
  >    on the local machine, means that local clangd won't work.
- Commit introducing machine scope: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/1fd2993b540ccf11c34234774f7cc53825d60edf
- Explanation of VSCode settings hierarchy: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/97616#issuecomment-633671266
  - package.json scope=machine : https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#Configuration-property-schema
- Example: consider the "User" and "Remote" tabs in the VSCode settings UI.
  Say `clangd.path` that is defined as "machine" scope.
    - In a Local workspace, the setting is applied if it is defined in User settings.
    - In a Remote workspace, the setting is applied if it is defined in Remote settings and the value defined in User settings is ignored.
    If the extension uses this code (note `Global`):
        vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('clangd').update('path', xxx, vscode.ConfigurationTarget.Global)
    - ...in a Local workspace, VSCode writes the value into user settings
    - ...in a Remote workspace, VSCode writes the value into remote user settings
