## Remote connect

Toolkit provides "remote connect" for CodeCatalyst, EC2, and ECS (terminal only). This means
customers can connect (1) a new VSCode instance and (2) a VSCode Terminal to remote machines in AWS
and CodeCatalyst.

### Design of remote connect

For connecting a new VSCode instance, remote connect works like this:

1. User chooses the machine they want to connect to (CodeCatalyst dev env, or EC2 machine)
1. Toolkit ensures that the [vscode remote-ssh extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) is installed.
1. Toolkit automatically downloads a private copy of `session-manager-plugin`, or uses its previous copy.
1. Toolkit ensures that the user's `~/.ssh/config` file contains a special host-name pattern.
    - The SSH config item defines a `ProxyCommand` that invokes a Toolkit-provided shell script [codecatalyst_connect](/packages/core/resources/codecatalyst_connect) or [ec2_connect](/packages/core/resources/ec2_connect).
1. Toolkit starts a SSM session using the service API.
1. Toolkit starts a new instance of VSCode with environment variables containing values needed to connect (SSM session id, etc).
1. VSCode invokes `ssh` which invokes the Toolkit-defined `ProxyCommand` mentioned above, which uses the environment variables to invoke `session-manager-plugin` to create an SSH connection.
1. VSCode's remote-ssh feature uses the SSH connection to provide remote VSCode session on the remote machine.

For connecting a new VSCode _terminal_, remote connect works like this:

1. User chooses the machine they want to connect to (CodeCatalyst dev env, EC2, or ECS machine)
1. Toolkit automatically downloads a private copy of `session-manager-plugin`, or uses its previous copy.
1. Toolkit starts a SSM session using the service API.
1. Toolkit [builds a session-manager-plugin command](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode/blob/c77fc076fd0ed837d077bc0318716b711a2854c8/packages/core/src/ecs/util.ts#L92-L104) and [passes it to a new VSCode Terminal](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode/blob/c77fc076fd0ed837d077bc0318716b711a2854c8/packages/core/src/ecs/commands.ts#L141-L147).
1. VSCode displays the terminal, so the user can enter shell commands on the remote machine.

For EC2 specifically, there are a few additional steps:

1. If connecting to EC2 instance via remote window, the toolkit generates temporary SSH keys (30 second lifetime), with the public key sent to the remote instance.
    - Key type is ed25519 if supported, or RSA otherwise.
1. If insufficient permissions are detected on the attached IAM role, toolkit will prompt to add an inline policy with the necessary actions.
1. If SSM sessions remain open after closing the window/terminal, the toolkit will terminate them on-shutdown, or when starting another session to the same instance.

### Implementation of remote connect

These modules show how to use and extend the "remote connect" functionality:

-   [shared/remoteSession.ts](/packages/core/src/shared/remoteSession.ts)
-   CodeCatalyst: [openDevEnv()](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode/blob/c77fc076fd0ed837d077bc0318716b711a2854c8/packages/core/src/codecatalyst/model.ts#L252)
-   EC2: [openSessionInTerminal()](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode/blob/c77fc076fd0ed837d077bc0318716b711a2854c8/packages/core/src/ec2/model.ts#L147)
-   ECS: [openTaskInTerminal()](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode/blob/c77fc076fd0ed837d077bc0318716b711a2854c8/packages/core/src/ecs/commands.ts#L133)
