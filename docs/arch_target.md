# Architecture: target requirements

> Describes the expected environment when the product is running on a user's machine.
> Corresponds to the "Physical view" of the [4+1 architectural views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model).

## Requirements / supported platforms

TODO

Software dependencies: Any external software components, libraries, or frameworks that the desktop
application depends on, such as runtime environments (e.g., .NET Framework, Java Runtime
Environment), database management systems, or third-party libraries.

Installation and deployment: The process of installing and deploying the desktop application on the
target hardware platforms. This may include details about installation packages (e.g., MSI, EXE,
DMG), installation scripts, deployment tools, and any specific configuration steps required.

System files and directories: The physical layout and structure of the application files on the
target system, including the location of executable files, libraries, configuration files, data
files, and log files.

Network configuration (if applicable): If the desktop application requires network connectivity for
certain features or services, the Physical View may describe the network protocols, ports, and any
specific network configurations required.

Hardware peripherals and devices: Any specific hardware peripherals or devices that the desktop
application interacts with, such as printers, scanners, cameras, or external storage devices.

Security considerations: Any physical security measures or considerations related to the deployment
environment, such as data encryption, secure storage, or access control mechanisms.

Monitoring and logging: The mechanisms and tools used for monitoring the application's performance,
logging application events, and collecting diagnostic information on the target hardware platforms.
