## <a id="sam-and-lambda"></a> AWS Serverless Applications

The AWS Toolkit enables you to develop [AWS serverless applications](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) locally. It also provides _CodeLenses_ in VS Code to do the following:

-   Use SAM (serverless application model) templates to build and debug your locally developed AWS serverless applications.
-   Run selected [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions.

To start debugging with a SAM template, click the `Add Debug Configuration` _CodeLens_ in the template file.

![Add Debug Configuration Template](./resources/marketplace/vscode/Codelens-YAML-template.png)

###### The _CodeLens_ indicator in the SAM template allows you to add a debug configuration for the serverless application.</h6>

Alternatively, you can run and debug just the AWS Lambda function and exclude other resources defined by the SAM template. Again, use a _CodeLens_ indicator for an AWS Lambda-function handler. (A _handler_ is a function that Lambda calls to start execution of a Lambda function.)

![Add Debug Configuration Direct](./resources/marketplace/vscode/Codelens-direct-function.png)

###### The _CodeLens_ indicator in the application file lets you add a debug configuration for a selected AWS Lambda function.

When you run a debug session, the status and results are shown in the **OUTPUT** panel when the **AWS Toolkit** output channel is selected.

![Configure and Run](./resources/marketplace/vscode/sam-configure-and-run-still.png)

###### After a local run is complete, the output appears in the **OUTPUT** tab.

When you're satisfied with performance, you can [deploy your serverless application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/toolkit-for-vscode/deploy-serverless-app). The SAM template is converted to a CloudFormation template, which is then used to deploy all the application's assets to the AWS Cloud.

### Launch config auto-completion ("IntelliSense")

The `Add Debug Configuration` _CodeLens_ creates launch configs of type
`aws-sam` in the VS Code `launch.json` file. You can also create these entries
by hand.

When editing `launch.json` configs, AWS Toolkit provides auto-completion and
contextual documentation, as shown below.

<img src="./resources/marketplace/vscode/sam-launch-config.png" alt="Debug Configuration inline documentation" width="640"/>

### Supported runtimes

The Toolkit _local SAM debugging_ feature supports these Lambda runtimes:

-   C# (.NET Core 2.1, 3.1; .NET 5.0, .NET 6.0)
-   Go (1.x)
-   Java (8, 8.al2, 11)
-   JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js 12.x, 14.x)
-   Python (3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9)

For more information see [Working with AWS Serverless Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/serverless-apps.html) in the user guide. To get setup for local debugging, see [Configuring your toolchain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/setup-toolchain.html).

## <a id="cloudwatchlogs"></a>Amazon CloudWatch Logs

The AWS Toolkit provides support for [Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/). Using the [AWS Explorer](#ui-components-aws-expl) of the Toolkit, you can perform the following operations on Log Groups:

-   List CloudWatch Log Groups
-   View Log Streams for a Log Group

Viewing a Log Stream will immediately load the most recent 10,000 lines or 1 MB of data (whichever is smaller), and their timestamps. From this view, users can access the following actions:

-   Load older or newer log events
-   Save currently-loaded Log Stream to a log file
-   Copy Log Stream name

Example:

![View Log Groups](./resources/marketplace/vscode/cloudwatch-logs.png)

# <a id="experimental-features"></a>Experimental Features

Sometimes we'll introduce experimental features that we're trying out. These may have bugs, usability problems or may not be fully functional, and because these
aren't ready for prime-time we'll hide them behind an experimental feature flag.

Experimental features can be enabled in the extension preferences
(`Preferences -> Settings -> Extensions -> AWS Configuration -> Experiments`).

Please note that experimental features may be disabled or removed at any time.
