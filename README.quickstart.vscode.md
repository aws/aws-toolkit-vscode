# <a id="top"></a>AWS Toolkit

AWS Toolkit is an extension for Visual Studio Code that enables you to interact with [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/).
See the [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/toolkit-for-vscode/welcome) for complete documentation.

See [Setup](#additional-setup-steps) for installation requirements, or [Get help](#get-help) for support.

## <a id="ui-components-cdk-expl"></a>CDK Explorer

The **AWS CDK Explorer** enables you to work with [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) applications. It shows a top-level view of your CDK applications that have been sythesized in your workspace.

![Overview, AWS CDK Explorer](./resources/marketplace/overview-cdk.png)

With the CDK explorer, you can navigate the CDK application's infrastructure stacks, resources, and policies.

## <a id="sam-and-lambda"></a> AWS Serverless Applications

The AWS Toolkit enables you to develop [AWS serverless applications](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) locally. It also provides _CodeLenses_ in VS Code to do the following:

-   Use SAM (serverless application model) templates to build and debug your locally developed AWS serverless applications.
-   Run selected [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions.

To start debugging with a SAM template, click the `Add Debug Configuration` _CodeLens_ in the template file.

![Add Debug Configuration Template](./resources/marketplace/Codelens-YAML-template.png)

###### The _CodeLens_ indicator in the SAM template allows you to add a debug configuration for the serverless application.</h6>

Alternatively, you can run and debug just the AWS Lambda function and exclude other resources defined by the SAM template. Again, use a _CodeLens_ indicator for an AWS Lambda-function handler. (A _handler_ is a function that Lambda calls to start execution of a Lambda function.)

![Add Debug Configuration Direct](./resources/marketplace/Codelens-direct-function.png)

###### The _CodeLens_ indicator in the application file lets you add a debug configuration for a selected AWS Lambda function.

When you run a debug session, the status and results are shown in the **OUTPUT** panel when the **AWS Toolkit** output channel is selected.

![Configure and Run 2](./resources/marketplace/sam-configure-and-run-still-2.png)

###### After a local run is complete, the output appears in the **OUTPUT** tab.

When you're satisfied with performance, you can [deploy your serverless application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/toolkit-for-vscode/deploy-serverless-app). The SAM template is converted to a CloudFormation template, which is then used to deploy all the application's assets to the AWS Cloud.

### Launch config auto-completion ("IntelliSense")

The `Add Debug Configuration` _CodeLens_ creates launch configs of type
`aws-sam` in the VS Code `launch.json` file. You can also create these entries
by hand.

When editing `launch.json` configs, AWS Toolkit provides auto-completion and
contextual documentation, as shown below.

### Supported runtimes

The Toolkit _local SAM debugging_ feature supports these runtimes:

-   C# (.NET Core 2.1)
    -   .NET Core 3.1 is supported for run but not debug
-   JavaScript (Node.js 10.x, 12.x)
-   Python (2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8)

For more information see [Working with AWS Serverless Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/serverless-apps.html) in the user guide.

## <a id="cloudwatchlogs"></a>Amazon CloudWatch Logs

The AWS Toolkit provides support for [Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/). Using the [AWS Explorer](#ui-components-aws-expl) of the Toolkit, you can perform the following operations on Log Groups:

-   List CloudWatch Log Groups
-   View Log Streams for a Log Group

Viewing a Log Stream will immediately load the most recent 10,000 lines or 1 MB of data (whichever is smaller), and their timestamps. From this view, users can access the following actions:

-   Load older or newer log events
-   Save currently-loaded Log Stream to a log file
-   Copy Log Stream name

Example:

![View Log Groups](./resources/marketplace/cloudwatch-logs.png)

For full details, see [Working with CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/cloudwatchlogs.html) in the Toolkit's user guide.

## <a id="eventbridge"></a>Amazon EventBridge Schemas

The AWS Toolkit provides support for [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge) schemas. Using the [AWS Explorer](#ui-components-aws-expl) of the Toolkit, you can perform the following operations on these schemas:

-   View an available schema
-   Search for an available schema
-   Generate code for an available schema

Example:

![View Amazon EventBridge Schemas](./resources/marketplace/eventbridge-search.png)

For full details, see [Working with Amazon EventBridge Schemas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/toolkit-for-vscode/eventbridge-schemas) in the Toolkit's user guide.

## <a id="ecs-files"></a>Amazon ECS task definition files

The AWS Toolkit provides support for [Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs). With the Toolkit installed in VS Code, IntelliSense functionality is provided for Amazon ECS task-definition files that you are updating in the editor.

Example:

![Amazon ECS IntelliSense for Task Definition Files](./resources/marketplace/ecs-task-def-intellisense.png)

## <a id="ssm-files"></a>AWS Systems Manager Documents

The AWS Toolkit provides support for [AWS Systems Manager Documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-documents.html). With the Toolkit installed in VS Code, you have access to the following features when working on Automation Documents:

-   Download, edit, and publish your Automation documents
-   Code completion and validation for both formats of documents: YAML and JSON
-   Templates and code snippets to help kickstart your Automation document

Example:

![AWS Systems Manager](./resources/marketplace/ssm-snippets.png)

-   Create, update, execute, and download state machines.
-   See live graph visualizations of your state machine.
-   Take advantage of features such as code completion and validation, and code snippets.

Example:

## <a id="aws-commands"></a>`AWS:` Commands

The Toolkit provides commands (prefixed with `AWS:`) to the VS Code _command
palette_, available by selecting _View > Command Palette_ or by typing
`CTRL-SHIFT-p` (macOS: `CMD-SHIFT-p`).
