# Root-cause SageMaker auth failure in Amazon Q for VSCode after v1.62.0

v1.63.0 of the extension introduced agentic chat and moved from directly calling the Q service using an AWS SDK client directly from the extension to indirectly
calling the Q service through the aws-lsp-codewhisperer service in language-servers (aka Flare).

## Notes

1. `isSageMaker` function used in many places in aws-toolkit-vscode codebase. `setContext` is used to set whether SMAI (`aws.isSageMaker`) or SMUS (`aws.isSageMakerUnifiedStudio`) is in use so that conditions testing those values can be used in package.json.
2. `aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/amazonq/src/lsp/chat/webviewProvider.ts` passes in booleans for SMAI and SMUS into MynahUI for Q Chat.
3. Files in `aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/core` apply to how the Amazon Q for VSCode extension used to call Q (formerly known as "CodeWhisperer") directly through an SDK client. It was this codebase that SageMaker depended on for authenticating with IAM credentials to Q. Files in `aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/amazonq` apply to how the extension now uses the LSP server (aka aws-lsp-codewhisperer in language-servers aka Flare) for indirectly accessing the Q service. The commit `938bb376647414776a55d7dd7d6761c863764c5c` is primarily what flipped over the extension from using core to amazonq leading to auth breaking for SageMaker.
4. Once we figure out how IAM credentials worked before (likely because core creates it's own SDK client and may do something fancy with auth that aws-lsp-codewhisperer does not), we may find that we need to apply a fix in aws-toolkit-vscode and/or language-servers.
5. Using the core (legacy) Q chat is not an option as the Amazon Q for VSCode team will not be maintaining it.
6. In user settings in VSCode, set `amazonq.trace.server` to `on` for more detailed logs from LSP server.
7. /Users/floralph/Source/P261194666.md contains A LOT of information about researching this issue so far. It can fill your context fast. We will refer to it from time to time and possibly migrate some of the most important information to this doc. You can ask about reading it, but don't read it unless I instruct you to do so and even then, you MUST stay focused only on what you've been asked to do with it.

## This is CRITICAL

When trying to root cause the issue, it is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL that we follow the path of execution related to the CodeWhisperer LSP server from start onwards without dropping the trail. We CANNOT just assume things about other parts of code based on names nor should we assume they are even related to our issue if they are not in the specific code path that we're following. We have to be laser focused on following the code path and looking for issues, not jumping to conclusions and jumping to other code. As we have to use logging as our only means of tracing/debugging in the SageMaker instance, we can use that to follow the path of execution.

## Repos on disk

1. /Users/floralph/Source/aws-toolkit-vscode
    1. Branch from breaking commit 938bb376647414776a55d7dd7d6761c863764c5c for experimenting on: bug/sm-auth
    2. Branch where you tried to add IAM creds using /Users/floralph/Source/P261194666.md: floralph/P261194666
2. /Users/floralph/Source/language-server-runtimes
3. /Users/floralph/Source/language-servers

If we absolutely need to look at MynahUI code, I can try to track it down. It might be lingering in one of the repos above though.

### Commit: 6ce383258 - "feat(sagemaker): free tier Q Chat with auto-login for iam users and login option for pro tier users (#5886)"

This commit shows how the Amazon Q for VSCode extension was updated (core only as the LSP server was not used by this extension at the time) to use
IAM credentials from SageMaker.

**Author:** Ahmed Ali (azkali) <a.husseinzaki@gmail.com>  
**Date:** October 29, 2024

#### Key Auth-Related Changes:

1. **SageMaker Cookie-Based Authentication Detection** in `packages/core/src/auth/activation.ts`:

    ```typescript
    interface SagemakerCookie {
        authMode?: 'Sso' | 'Iam'
    }

    export async function initialize(loginManager: LoginManager): Promise<void> {
        if (isAmazonQ() && isSageMaker()) {
            // The command `sagemaker.parseCookies` is registered in VS Code Sagemaker environment.
            const result = (await vscode.commands.executeCommand('sagemaker.parseCookies')) as SagemakerCookie
            if (result.authMode !== 'Sso') {
                initializeCredentialsProviderManager()
            }
        }
    ```

2. **New Credentials Provider Manager Initialization** in `packages/core/src/auth/utils.ts`:

    ```typescript
    export function initializeCredentialsProviderManager() {
        const manager = CredentialsProviderManager.getInstance()
        manager.addProviderFactory(new SharedCredentialsProviderFactory())
        manager.addProviders(
            new Ec2CredentialsProvider(),
            new EcsCredentialsProvider(),
            new EnvVarsCredentialsProvider()
        )
    }
    ```

3. **Modified CodeWhisperer Auth Validation** in `packages/core/src/codewhisperer/util/authUtil.ts`:

    ```typescript
    // BEFORE:
    if (isSageMaker()) {
        return isIamConnection(conn)
    }

    // AFTER:
    return (
        (isSageMaker() && isIamConnection(conn)) ||
        (isCloud9('codecatalyst') && isIamConnection(conn)) ||
        (isSsoConnection(conn) && hasScopes(conn, codeWhispererCoreScopes))
    )
    ```

4. **Amazon Q Connection Validation Enhanced**:

    ```typescript
    export const isValidAmazonQConnection = (conn?: Connection): conn is Connection => {
        return (
            (isSageMaker() && isIamConnection(conn)) ||
            ((isSsoConnection(conn) || isBuilderIdConnection(conn)) &&
                isValidCodeWhispererCoreConnection(conn) &&
                hasScopes(conn, amazonQScopes))
        )
    }
    ```

5. **Dual Chat Client Implementation** in `packages/core/src/codewhispererChat/clients/chat/v0/chat.ts`:

    ```typescript
    // New IAM-based chat method
    async chatIam(chatRequest: SendMessageRequest): Promise<SendMessageCommandOutput> {
        const client = await createQDeveloperStreamingClient()
        const response = await client.sendMessage(chatRequest)
        // ... session handling
    }

    // Existing SSO-based chat method
    async chatSso(chatRequest: GenerateAssistantResponseRequest): Promise<GenerateAssistantResponseCommandOutput> {
        const client = await createCodeWhispererChatStreamingClient()
        // ... existing logic
    }
    ```

6. **Chat Controller Route Selection** in `packages/core/src/codewhispererChat/controllers/chat/controller.ts`:
    ```typescript
    if (isSsoConnection(AuthUtil.instance.conn)) {
        const { $metadata, generateAssistantResponseResponse } = await session.chatSso(request)
        response = { $metadata: $metadata, message: generateAssistantResponseResponse }
    } else {
        const { $metadata, sendMessageResponse } = await session.chatIam(request as SendMessageRequest)
        response = { $metadata: $metadata, message: sendMessageResponse }
    }
    ```

#### Key Findings:

-   **Two separate Q API clients**: `createQDeveloperStreamingClient()` for IAM, `createCodeWhispererChatStreamingClient()` for SSO
-   **SageMaker cookie-based auth detection**: Uses `sagemaker.parseCookies` command to determine auth mode
-   **Automatic credential provider setup**: Initializes EC2, ECS, and environment variable credential providers for IAM users
-   **Route selection based on connection type**: SSO connections use old client, IAM connections use new Q Developer client

## Related Historical Fix - CodeWhisperer SageMaker Authentication

**Commit ID:** `b125a1bd3b135344d2aa24961e746a10e55702c6`  
**Author:** Lei Gao  
**Date:** March 18, 2024  
**Title:** "fix(codewhisperer): completion error in sagemaker #4545"

### Problem Identified

In SageMaker Code Editor, CodeWhisperer was failing with:

```
Unexpected key 'optOutPreference' found in params
```

### Root Cause

SageMaker environments require **GenerateRecommendation** API calls instead of **ListRecommendation** API calls for SigV4 authentication to work properly.

### Fix Applied

Modified `packages/core/src/codewhisperer/service/recommendationHandler.ts`:

```typescript
// BEFORE: Used pagination logic that triggered ListRecommendation
if (pagination) {
    // ListRecommendation request - FAILS in SageMaker
}

// AFTER: SageMaker detection forces GenerateRecommendation
if (pagination && !isSM) {
    // Added !isSM condition
    // ListRecommendation only for non-SageMaker
} else {
    // GenerateRecommendation for SageMaker (and non-pagination cases)
}
```

## Key Insights

### Pattern Recognition

Both issues share the same fundamental problem: **SageMaker environments have different API authentication requirements** that break standard AWS SDK calls.

### Hypothesis for Current Issue

The Amazon Q LSP (enabled by default in v1.63.0) is likely making API calls that:

1. Work fine in standard environments
2. Fail in SageMaker due to different credential passing mechanisms
3. Require SageMaker-specific request formatting (similar to CodeWhisperer fix)

# Files

## aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/amazonq/src/extension.ts

Starts both the old "core" CodeWhisperer code with `await activateCodeWhisperer(extContext as ExtContext)` on line ~121, followed by the new LSP code for Amazon Q. Maybe the dev team is slowly migrating functionality from core to amazonq and this is how they have both running at once. The code below is one of 3 places where the 'amazonqLSP' experiment is set to on by default in the commit that broke SageMaker auth.

```typescript
// This contains every lsp agnostic things (auth, security scan, code scan)
await activateCodeWhisperer(extContext as ExtContext)
if (Experiments.instance.get('amazonqLSP', true)) {
    await activateAmazonqLsp(context)
}
```

`activateAmazonqLsp` downloads and installs the language-servers bundle then executes the CodeWhisperer start up script (we should find the specific name and path) and initializes the LSP server, including auth set up.

## aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/core/src/auth/activation.ts

This file appears critical to how the SageMaker auth worked. It is in core however, and not clear whether it is even in the code path for the LSP server or not. We should review this file closely to understand how IAM credentials worked as it should inform us on what needs to change in the amazonq package to support IAM credentials as well. The `sagemaker.parseCookies` code here also seems important in determining whether the SageMaker instance wants to use IAM or SSO, so that should probably be carried over into the amazonq package as well.

The `Auth.instance.onDidChangeActiveConnection` handler code should be investigated further. It's not clear if it has anything to do with auth to Q or if it's just older "toolkit"-related auth stuff.

## aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/core/src/auth/utils.ts

This is a collection of utility functions and many are related to auth/security. However, it appears to be `initializeCredentialsProviderManager` in our code path, called by `aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/core/src/auth/activation.ts` that may be of importance. We should determine if we need this or similar functionality in amazonq package or if this is just a hold-over that updates the old "toolkit" (i.e. non-Amazon Q parts of the extension) stuff.

## aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/amazonq/src/lsp/client.ts

1. line ~68 sets `providesBearerToken: true` but doesn't appear to have anything similar for IAM credentials.
2. line ~93 to the end starts auth for LSP using the `AmazonQLspAuth` class. This all appears to be for SSO tokens, nothing for IAM credentials.

## aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/amazonq/src/lsp/auth.ts

1. Defines `AmazonQLspAuth` class that is only for SSO tokens, nothing about IAM credentials.
2. Some SSO token related functions are exported, but nothing similar for IAM credentials.

## aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/core/src/codewhisperer/activation.ts

`activate` in the old "core" Q implementation is called by `aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/amazonq/src/extension.ts` line ~121.

Suspcious code that is still running in `activate` function. How does this not interfer with the new auth code in the amazonq package?

```typescript
// initialize AuthUtil earlier to make sure it can listen to connection change events.
const auth = AuthUtil.instance
auth.initCodeWhispererHooks()
```

Further down in this file it still creates and uses `onst client = new codewhispererClient.DefaultCodeWhispererClient()` which makes it appear to be using both direct calls from the extension as well as the LSP to access the Q service. This bears further investigation into what this code is actually doing.

## aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/core/src/codewhisperer/client/codewhisperer.ts

This is the old "core" CodeWhisperer service client. There is likely important code here that informs how IAM authentication works with the service client that may be missing in the language-servers CodeWhisperer client. If my hunch is correct in that the "core" code is still in use for what hasn't been migrated yet, this code may not be actively used for Q Chat which was migrated (see the Experiments flags defaulting to true in the breaking commit) to the amazonq package and should be using the auth there and in language-servers.

## aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/amazonq/src/extensionNode.ts

The code below is one of 3 places where the 'amazonqChatLSP' experiment is set to on by default in the commit that broke SageMaker auth. There is some "auth"-related code in this file that should be investigated further to determine if it has any impact on the broken SageMaker auth. It isn't obvious that it does or doesn't. It may just be used in the MynahUI Q Chat webview, and not the LSP server.

```typescript
if (!Experiments.instance.get('amazonqChatLSP', true)) {
```

## aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/core/src/auth/auth.ts

This file was updated recently for the SMUS project. It may not be directly related to the broken SageMaker auth issue, but the comments on the added/changed functions are suspicious regarding how credentials are received. SMUS may be adding a different way to get IAM credentials than what SMAI used.

```typescript
/**
 * Returns true if credentials are provided by the environment (ex. via ~/.aws/)
 *
 * @param isC9 boolean for if Cloud9 is host
 * @param isSM boolean for if SageMaker is host
 * @returns boolean for if C9 "OR" SM
 */
export function hasVendedIamCredentials(isC9?: boolean, isSM?: boolean) {
    isC9 ??= isCloud9()
    isSM ??= isSageMaker()
    return isSM || isC9
}

/**
 * Returns true if credentials are provided by the metadata files in environment (ex. for IAM via ~/.aws/ and in a future case with SSO, from /cache or /sso)
 * @param isSMUS boolean if SageMaker Unified Studio is host
 * @returns boolean if SMUS
 */
export function hasVendedCredentialsFromMetadata(isSMUS?: boolean) {
    isSMUS ??= isSageMaker('SMUS')
    return isSMUS
}
```

There is also A LOT of other auth related functionality here, but it's in "core" and may not be directly related the code paths for LSP and breaking auth in SageMaker.

## aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/core/src/codewhisperer/util/authUtil.ts

There is some `isSageMaker`-related code here that we should investigate. It appears to be important to auth with SageMaker, but it's not clear if it or similar code is needed and has made it into the amazonq package. Once we confirm any of this code is in our code path of concern, it should be investigated further.

## aws-toolkit-vscode/packages/amazonq/src/lsp/chat/webviewProvider.ts

While there is special SageMaker handling in this file, it is not clear if it is related to IAM auth issues with the LSP or it is just related to the chat UI. If we find it is in our code path, we can investigate further.

# Proposed Fix for SageMaker IAM Authentication in Amazon Q LSP

> **NOTE:** We should start back tomorrow by addressing the issues and concerns raised in this document first thing, particularly the SageMaker cookie detection and connection metadata handling for IAM authentication.

## Issue Summary

The Amazon Q extension for VSCode fails to authenticate in SageMaker environments after v1.62.0 due to a change in architecture. The extension moved from directly calling the Q service using an AWS SDK client to indirectly calling it through the aws-lsp-codewhisperer service (Flare). While the old implementation had specific handling for SageMaker IAM credentials, the new LSP-based implementation only supports SSO token authentication.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Breaking Change

Commit `938bb376647414776a55d7dd7d6761c863764c5c` enabled three experiment flags by default:

1. `amazonqLSP` in `packages/amazonq/src/extension.ts` (line ~119) - Controls whether to activate the Amazon Q LSP
2. `amazonqChatLSP` in `packages/amazonq/src/extensionNode.ts` (line ~53) - Controls whether to use the legacy chat provider or the LSP-based chat provider
3. `amazonqChatLSP` in `packages/amazonq/src/lsp/client.ts` (line ~117) - Controls whether to activate the chat functionality in the LSP client

This change moved the extension from using the core implementation to the LSP implementation, which lacks IAM credential support.

### Recent IAM Support in Language-Servers Repository

A significant recent commit in the language-servers repository adds IAM authentication support:

**Commit ID:** 16b287b9e
**Author:** sdharani91
**Date:** 2025-06-26
**Title:** feat: enable iam auth for agentic chat (#1736)

Key changes in this commit:

1. **Environment Variable Flag**:

    ```typescript
    // Added function to check for IAM auth mode
    export function isUsingIAMAuth(): boolean {
        return process.env.USE_IAM_AUTH === 'true'
    }
    ```

2. **Service Manager Selection**:

    ```typescript
    // In qAgenticChatServer.ts
    amazonQServiceManager = isUsingIAMAuth() ? getOrThrowBaseIAMServiceManager() : getOrThrowBaseTokenServiceManager()
    ```

3. **IAM Credentials Handling**:

    ```typescript
    // Added function to extract IAM credentials
    export function getIAMCredentialsFromProvider(credentialsProvider: CredentialsProvider) {
        if (!credentialsProvider.hasCredentials('iam')) {
            throw new Error('Missing IAM creds')
        }

        const credentials = credentialsProvider.getCredentials('iam') as Credentials
        return {
            accessKeyId: credentials.accessKeyId,
            secretAccessKey: credentials.secretAccessKey,
            sessionToken: credentials.sessionToken,
        }
    }
    ```

4. **Unified Chat Response Interface**:

    ```typescript
    // Created types to handle both auth flows
    export type ChatCommandInput = SendMessageCommandInput | GenerateAssistantResponseCommandInputCodeWhispererStreaming
    export type ChatCommandOutput =
        | SendMessageCommandOutput
        | GenerateAssistantResponseCommandOutputCodeWhispererStreaming
    ```

5. **Source Parameter for IAM**:
    ```typescript
    // Added source parameter for IAM requests
    request.source = 'IDE'
    ```

This commit shows that IAM authentication support has been added to the language-servers repository, but the extension needs to set the `USE_IAM_AUTH` environment variable to `true` when running in SageMaker environments.

## Proposed Fix

Based on our investigation of the language-server-runtimes repository and the previous implementation attempt, here's a refined solution:

1. **Set Environment Variable for IAM Auth**:

    ```typescript
    // In packages/core/src/shared/lsp/utils/platform.ts
    const env = { ...process.env }
    if (isSageMaker()) {
        // Check SageMaker cookie to determine auth mode
        try {
            const result = await vscode.commands.executeCommand('sagemaker.parseCookies')
            if (result?.authMode !== 'Sso') {
                env.USE_IAM_AUTH = 'true'
                getLogger().info(`[SageMaker Debug] Setting USE_IAM_AUTH=true for language server process`)
            }
        } catch (err) {
            getLogger().error('Failed to parse SageMaker cookies: %O', err)
            // Default to IAM auth if cookie parsing fails
            env.USE_IAM_AUTH = 'true'
            getLogger().info(`[SageMaker Debug] Setting USE_IAM_AUTH=true for language server process (default)`)
        }
    }

    const lspProcess = new ChildProcess(bin, args, {
        warnThresholds,
        spawnOptions: { env },
    })
    ```

2. **Enhance `AmazonQLspAuth` Class** (`packages/amazonq/src/lsp/auth.ts`):

    ```typescript
    async refreshConnection(force: boolean = false) {
        const activeConnection = this.authUtil.conn
        if (this.authUtil.isConnectionValid()) {
            if (isSsoConnection(activeConnection)) {
                // Existing SSO path
                const token = await this.authUtil.getBearerToken()
                await (force ? this._updateBearerToken(token) : this.updateBearerToken(token))
            } else if (isSageMaker() && isIamConnection(activeConnection)) {
                // SageMaker IAM path
                try {
                    const credentials = await this.authUtil.getCredentials()
                    if (credentials && credentials.accessKeyId && credentials.secretAccessKey) {
                        await (force ? this._updateIamCredentials(credentials) : this.updateIamCredentials(credentials))
                    } else {
                        getLogger().error('Invalid IAM credentials: %O', credentials)
                    }
                } catch (err) {
                    getLogger().error('Failed to get IAM credentials: %O', err)
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public updateIamCredentials = onceChanged(this._updateIamCredentials.bind(this))
    private async _updateIamCredentials(credentials: any) {
        try {
            // Extract only the required fields to match the expected format
            const iamCredentials = {
                accessKeyId: credentials.accessKeyId,
                secretAccessKey: credentials.secretAccessKey,
                sessionToken: credentials.sessionToken,
            }

            const request = await this.createUpdateIamCredentialsRequest(iamCredentials)
            await this.client.sendRequest(iamCredentialsUpdateRequestType.method, request)
            this.client.info(`UpdateIamCredentials: Success`)
        } catch (err) {
            getLogger().error('Failed to update IAM credentials: %O', err)
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Update Connection Metadata Handler** (`packages/amazonq/src/lsp/client.ts`):

    ```typescript
    client.onRequest<ConnectionMetadata, Error>(notificationTypes.getConnectionMetadata.method, () => {
        // For IAM auth, provide a default startUrl
        if (process.env.USE_IAM_AUTH === 'true') {
            return {
                sso: {
                    startUrl: 'https://amzn.awsapps.com/start', // Default for IAM auth
                },
            }
        }

        // For SSO auth, use the actual startUrl
        return {
            sso: {
                startUrl: AuthUtil.instance.auth.startUrl,
            },
        }
    })
    ```

4. **Modify Client Initialization** (`packages/amazonq/src/lsp/client.ts`):

    ```typescript
    const useIamAuth = isSageMaker() && process.env.USE_IAM_AUTH === 'true'

    initializationOptions: {
        // ...
        credentials: {
            providesBearerToken: !useIamAuth,
            providesIam: useIamAuth,
        },
    }
    ```

5. **Ensure Auto-login Happens Early** (`packages/amazonq/src/lsp/activation.ts`):
    ```typescript
    export async function activate(ctx: vscode.ExtensionContext): Promise<void> {
        try {
            // Check for SageMaker and auto-login if needed
            if (isSageMaker()) {
                try {
                    const result = await vscode.commands.executeCommand('sagemaker.parseCookies')
                    if (result?.authMode !== 'Sso') {
                        // Auto-login with IAM credentials
                        const sagemakerProfileId = asString({
                            credentialSource: 'ec2',
                            credentialTypeId: 'sagemaker-instance',
                        })
                        await Auth.instance.tryAutoConnect(sagemakerProfileId)
                        getLogger().info(`Automatically connected with SageMaker IAM credentials`)
                    }
                } catch (err) {
                    getLogger().error('Failed to parse SageMaker cookies: %O', err)
                }
            }

            await lspSetupStage('all', async () => {
                const installResult = await new AmazonQLspInstaller().resolve()
                await lspSetupStage('launch', async () => await startLanguageServer(ctx, installResult.resourcePaths))
            })
        } catch (err) {
            const e = err as ToolkitError
            void vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Unable to launch amazonq language server: ${e.message}`)
        }
    }
    ```

This refined solution addresses the issues identified in the previous implementation attempt:

1. It properly checks the SageMaker cookie to determine the auth mode
2. It ensures the IAM credentials are formatted correctly
3. It adds robust error handling
4. It ensures auto-login happens early in the initialization process

# Next Steps

## Plan for SageMaker Environment Testing

We are going to set up a comprehensive testing environment on the SageMaker instance to debug and fix the IAM authentication issue:

1. **Repository Setup**:

    - Clone aws-toolkit-vscode repository (already done locally)
    - Clone language-servers repository to SageMaker instance
    - Configure aws-toolkit-vscode to use local build of language-servers instead of downloaded version

2. **Development Workflow**:

    - Make changes to language-servers codebase directly on SageMaker instance
    - Add comprehensive logging throughout the authentication flow
    - Test changes immediately in the SageMaker environment where the issue occurs
    - Use `amazonq.trace.server` setting for detailed LSP server logs

3. **Key Areas to Investigate**:

    - Verify that `USE_IAM_AUTH` environment variable is properly set and inherited
    - Confirm IAM credentials are correctly passed from extension to language server
    - Validate that language server selects correct service manager based on auth mode
    - Test that SageMaker cookie detection works properly

4. **Debugging Strategy**:

    - Follow the exact code execution path from extension activation to LSP authentication
    - Add logging at each critical step to trace the authentication flow
    - Capture and analyze any errors or failures in the authentication process
    - Compare behavior between working SSO environments and failing SageMaker IAM environment

5. **Implementation Priority**:
    - First implement SageMaker cookie detection to determine auth mode
    - Add IAM credential handling to AmazonQLspAuth class
    - Ensure proper environment variable setting for language server process
    - Test and validate the complete authentication flow

This approach will allow us to make real-time changes and immediately test them in the actual environment where the authentication failure occurs, giving us the best chance to identify and fix the root cause.

## Critical Issues to Address First

The document emphasizes that we should **"start back tomorrow by addressing the issues and concerns raised in this document first thing, particularly the SageMaker cookie detection and connection metadata handling for IAM authentication."**

The most critical missing pieces are:

1. **SageMaker cookie detection** to determine when to use IAM vs SSO auth
2. **Connection metadata handling** for IAM authentication
3. **Proper error handling** throughout the authentication flow

These should be implemented before testing the solution in a SageMaker environment.
